# REST API - Frontend

This REST API - Frontend is a frontend API and works as a load-balancer to serve multiple models, by pointing the predictions to different model versions.

In this case, it is only connected to the Server (app) API.

If you want to deploy it, follow the [Complete deployment of all containers with Docker Compose and usage](../../README.md#complete-deployment-of-all-containers-with-docker-compose-and-usage) instructions.
